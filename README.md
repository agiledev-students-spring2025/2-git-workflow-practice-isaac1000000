### My article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable
### Commentary:
I was recently shown this article by a friend and thought it was an amusing read about how the naming habits we know well in software engineering have come to be. It's fun to think of language as having some sort of mathematical basis and so I think I greatly appreciate the idea of words like 'foo' and 'bar' being linguistic filler variables. Also, it's cute to see what other languages use for their metasyntactic variables - my personal favorites are Italian's 'pippo', 'pluto', and 'paperino'.

### Commentary:
I also never realized these placeholders had such a rich, cross-cultural history until this article. The Italian variables like "pippo," "pluto" are interesting, showing how programming cultures whimsically adapt local references. It’s funny how we all just absorb these quirks as "normal," never digging into their roots—like coding’s inside jokes that quietly span languages and continents.
