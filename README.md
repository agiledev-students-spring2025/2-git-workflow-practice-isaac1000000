### My article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable
### Commentary:
I was recently shown this article by a friend and thought it was an amusing read about how the naming habits we know well in software engineering have come to be. It's fun to think of language as having some sort of mathematical basis and so I think I greatly appreciate the idea of words like 'foo' and 'bar' being linguistic filler variables. Also, it's cute to see what other languages use for their metasyntactic variables - my personal favorites are Italian's 'pippo', 'pluto', and 'paperino'.
